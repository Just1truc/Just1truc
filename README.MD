# About Me

Hi, I'm a first year IT student at [**Epitech**](https://www.epitech.eu/), a High-level French IT School.
If you're looking for a developper, you can check my projects on this account or my resume on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-duc-51b09b225/).

Also, i'm currently looking for an intership in Fullstack for 6 month around the city of Lyon.

#### My Story

I discorvered the joy of programming when I was 12 years old, the day I followed a tutorial on *How to make a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game* in **Basic**. This was the first time I programmed. However, this interest quickly vanished after the end of my hollidays this year.

2 years Later, when I was 14 years, I had to choose the specialities I would study for 2 years for my *baccalaureat*.
At the time, I wanted to be a *game designer* so choose Maths, Computer Science and Art.

During that year, i discovered many programming languages and the basics of IT. I also began to specialize in the use of **Python** as it was the language that we studied the most. However, I tried **HTML/CSS**.

During summer, I tried using pygame to make a video game but it wasn't that great. While making this game, i discovered about **OOP**.

The next year, I had to decide which speciality I would drop and specialise in the other 2. As I tought Art was useless, I decided to drop it and therefore specialize in Maths and Computer Science taking as an optionnal speciality *Math Expert*.
I learned a lot about algorithmic and discover many aspects of IT in many subjects.
If you are interested in what I studied, here are the [topics](https://eduscol.education.fr/2068/programmes-et-ressources-en-numerique-et-sciences-informatiques-voie-g).
I worked 1 month on a project about databases using sql queries in python. This [project](https://github.com/Just1truc/Old-Python-Sql-Project) made me discover **SQL**.

Now, I'm studying at **Epitech** discorvered many Languages. At epitech, i essencially worked in **C** at my IT School. However, in personnal project, i worked using **python**, **React** on a **Netflix** clone project and **express js**, **Docker**, **js**.
