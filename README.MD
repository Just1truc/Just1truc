### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a final-year student at **EPITECH Lyon** and recently completed an exchange year at **Tsinghua University**.  
With **5 years of hands-on software experience** across the stack, I’ve explored nearly every major domain of computer science and chosen to **specialize in Artificial Intelligence**.  
I enjoy digging into the math and systems engineering that power modern ML—then open-sourcing the tools I wish existed.

### 🚀 Notable Projects

| Project | Brief |
|---------|-------|
| [`treat`](https://github.com/Just1truc/treat) | **Novel sub-quadratic attention** framework built on *Binary-Tree Attention Trees* composed from Linear Attention. Achieves **O(n log n)** context aggregation while retaining full-sequence fidelity. |
| [`saute`](https://github.com/tzhengtek/saute) | Multi-party discourse processor with **hierarchical EDU-level parsing** and **speaker-aware memory**, implemented via stacked linear-attention blocks for efficient long-context reasoning. |
| [`dtorch`](https://github.com/Just1truc/dtorch) | Minimal autograd + neural-network library—clean codebase for educational deep-learning research. |
| [`Argos`](https://github.com/Just1truc/Argos) | Real-time remote desktop manager leveraging WebRTC, Socket.IO, and low-level thread orchestration. |
| [`excalidraw-latex-gen`](https://github.com/Just1truc/excalidraw-latex-gen) | CLI to generate LaTeX-based Excalidraw diagrams automatically. |
| [`Abricot-Norminette`](https://github.com/Just1truc/Abricot-Norminette) | Ultra-fast, multithreaded C style-checker adopted by EPITECH cohorts. |

Although I’ve delved into everything from compiler design to distributed systems, **AI remains my primary focus**. Blockchain is about the only field I haven’t explored—yet.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
